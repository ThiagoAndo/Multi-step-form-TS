## My process

### What I learned

<div style="text-align: justify">
I chose the Multi-step form challenge because it offered a reasonable coding demand, and I love coding! Completing this challenge allowed me to learn how to test webpage functionality, prevent bugs, and ensure everything works as intended. I decided to enhance the original workflow to provide users with a better experience.

First, after users enter their information and click the "Next Step" button, the page will store their data and selections in the browser's local storage.

Second, I've set the default plan to the basic "Arcade/mo" option to streamline the process for users.

Finally, if users choose not to select any additional services, the page will prompt them to confirm their decision, ensuring they don't miss out on valuable options.
